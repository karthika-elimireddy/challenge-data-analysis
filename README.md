# Project Overview
This is a project done as a part of Data Science and AI course at Becode in 2024.
To do the project we took an already exciting dataset with information about at least 10.000 properties all over Belgium.   
1. Data Cleaning to handle null values and outliers.
2. Correlation of different variables of the dataset.
3. Data interpretion and visualisation of the analysis done.


# Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x installed.
2. pip for managing Python packages.
3. Jupyter Notebook.
4. GeoPandas
5. Pandas
6. Seaborn and Matplotlib




# Usage

This script will:
1. Reads the dataset from a csv.  
2. Performs some cleaning and try and find some outliers from the dataset.
3. Cleaned data is used to find correlation of the different variables in the dataset.
4. Plot the understood influensers.


# Structure
The project has the following core components:

    postcode_municipality.csv
    cleaned_dataset.csv
    data_manipulation.ipynb.
