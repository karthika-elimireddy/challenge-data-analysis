## Remarks
- new colum price/sqm can cause issue because you duplicate the correlation between price and sqm
- price per sqm vs living area is interesting
- nice strategy to handle small municipalities
- distribution of properties per province is good
- nice storytelling and cool bonus :thumsup: That's an original way to loot at the data
- notebook well structured and it's great to have a markdown summary
- don't forget to remove useless branches at the end of a project! But nice git management
- Colors in vizualisations are almost the same blue everywhere, try playing more with colors next time
- project architecture is good
- Good work :fire:
